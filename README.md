# ML-Models
Some machine learning models that I have written from scratch in Python using only numpy for calculus and linear algebra calculations. 

I have made:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. PCA
Naive Bayes (IP)
Simple Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Network
Recurrent Neural Network (IP)
